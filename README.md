# SeisOpt-Picker

This is partial code from Picker, the program I developed during my time at Optim. 

# What does this program do?

Picker allows seismologists to make picks on where our field equipment detected a break in the subsurface. After analyzing each graph, they could add geometric data to each pick in order to have correct calculations on exported data. This program's exported data was then imported into another program where seismologists would further analyze the pick calculations.
